# This is Ty's homework for week 3

## ... no longer 2, not yet 4

*no advanced math was used* **THIS TIME**

However, I did have to clamp down on my python passion

# Answers to your questions
The variables flow, year, month, and day are so well named that their definitions are obvious ... good coding practices!

They are all Lists
 - day, month and year are lists of integers
 - flow is a list of floats
 - they are all 1D, with length 11573

My estimated flow LAST WEEK as 198.

The flow exceeded this 178 times in September in the record.
There were 937 September days, so 19% of days exceeded.

Before 2001: 101 days, 28%
After 2009: 34 days, 11%
